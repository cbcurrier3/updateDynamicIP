# UpdateDynamicIP

A very simple bash script that uses Check Point R80.10 APIs in order to update the public IP address you got from your ISP.

## Getting Started

If you are using a dynamic public IP address, this can change without knowing in advance. 
If your public IP address changes, you will not be able to perform some operation properly (manual NATs, VPN remote access, etc..).

This script checks if the object representing your public IP address is the actual public dynamic IP address you received from your ISP. If it's different, it means the IP changed, so the scripts uses several APIs in order to update the object IP address, update the gateway topology and install the policy. 


### Prerequisites

* I assume a standalone environment (Management Server and Gateway are running in the same appliance).

* I assume you have an object representing the dynamic public IP address you received from your ISP. This object can be used in policy rule base, NAT rules, and so on.

* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) - A lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor (already installed in R80.10 Management Server). I used this tool to parse the json object.


### Installing

1. Copy the script in a folder (within the Management Server)
2. Open the script with your favorite text editor and set the variables according to your environment
2. Give it execution permission
3. Put the script in crontab (for example you can run this job each 10 minutes)

### Notes

I wrote this just for fun and to learn (and play) a little bit more about Check Point Management APIs. 

Only tested in R80.10 Standalone environment.
